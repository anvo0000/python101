# How Ethereal Works
## Send email by  ethereal.email
# it's only a fake SMTP serviceâ€”it does not send real emails to external addresses like Gmail.
# It intercepts emails instead of delivering them.
# Emails sent using Ethereal stay in their dashboard for testing.
# You can check how your email looks without actually sending it to a recipient.
